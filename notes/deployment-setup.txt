npm install led to an issue installing 'node-zopfli'. It was solved with help
from here:
https://github.com/webpack-contrib/zopfli-webpack-plugin/issues/4

by entering these commands on the droplet:
sudo apt install build-essential
npm update

Follow the tutorial to completion, add the networking info to digitalocean and
the registrar, troubleshoot any of the inevitable issues (ugh, initial deployment
is the worst) and hopefully the app will be up and running




Steps for continuous deployment:

Push changes to github
ssh into droplet
sudo docker ps (sudo password stored in LastPass secure note if you need it)
sudo docker stop [ContainerID]
git pull origin master
npm install
npm run build
sudo docker build . -t wallawallabands
sudo docker run -p 4000:4000 wallawallabands
