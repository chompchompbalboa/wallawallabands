Steps for deployment:

Push changes to github
ssh into droplet
sudo docker ps (sudo password stored in LastPass secure note if you need it)
sudo docker stop [ContainerID]
git pull origin master
npm install
npm run build
sudo docker build . -t wallawallabands
sudo docker run -p 4000:4000 -v /data/wallawallabands.sqlite:/data/wallawallabands.sqlite wallawallabands


Backing up the database:
ssh into droplet
cd into wallawallabands_db folder
git status -- confirm that we are up-to-date with master
sudo docker ps -- Get the container name
sudo docker cp [ContainerName]:/src/data/wallawallabands.sqlite .
git add .
git commit -m "[Date]"
git push -f origin master
