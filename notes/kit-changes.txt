Kit Changes:

1) Update webpack config to bypass host check so that I can run the app off
   of a "realestate.local" domain during development.  This is a security
   issue that I will eventually need to come up with a better solution for.

   File: kit/webpack/base.js
   Lines: 40-43
   Added the following lines:

   START

   devServer: {
    compress: true,
    disableHostCheck: true,
  },

	 END

2) Update the kit to fix a FOUC I was seeing thanks to an issue with
styled-components and SSR.

The fix can be found here:

3) Update the kit to use apollo-upload-server. This allows us to upload files
   using GraphQL mutations

   File: kit/entry/server.js
   Lines: 77-79
   Added the following lines:

   START

   // Apollo Upload Server to allow us to upload files using Apollo
   // This is not a part of the kit and was added by Rocky
   import { apolloUploadKoa } from 'apollo-upload-server'

   END

   Same file
   Line 352
   Added the following line:

   START

   apolloUploadKoa(),

   END
