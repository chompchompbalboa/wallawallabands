Kit Changes:

1) Update webpack config to bypass host check so that I can run the app off
   of a "realestate.local" domain during development.  This is a security
   issue that I will eventually need to come up with a better solution for.

   File: kit/webpack/base.js
   Lines: 40-43
   Added the following lines:

   START

   devServer: {
    compress: true,
    disableHostCheck: true,
  },

	 END
